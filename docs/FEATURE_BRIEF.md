## Problem

Small businesses often juggle multiple platforms (Google, Yelp, Facebook) without a centralized way to monitor reviews, post updates, or manage their online reputation.

## Goal

Build a web-based dashboard that allows small businesses to:
- View and respond to reviews from Google and Yelp
- Schedule social media posts (Facebook/Instagram basic integration)
- Monitor engagement metrics (reviews received, star ratings, post likes)
- Receive real-time alerts for new reviews or negative feedback

---

## Users

- Small Business Owners
- Store Managers
- Social Media Managers (optional later)

---

## MVP Scope

- User authentication and account setup
- OAuth integration with Google, Yelp, Facebook
- Dashboard displaying recent reviews and upcoming scheduled posts
- Ability to respond to reviews
- Ability to schedule a social post
- Simple analytics (count of reviews by star rating)

---

## Nice to Haves (Post-MVP)

- Instagram Direct posting
- SMS notifications
- Multi-store management
- Review sentiment analysis (basic AI)

---

## Key Constraints

- Minimal third-party costs initially (watch API pricing)
- Focus on web only (no mobile app yet)
- Privacy and security: do not store passwords from external platforms
